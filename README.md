# Automatic Duty Allocation (ADA)
## Automatic Duty Allocation for ACS (International) Prefects

ADA is an Apps Script automation to allocate duties for both school and house prefects. It is able to automatically generate the attendance sheets and provide high-quality duty allocations taking into account:
- Total number of duties
- Number of duties that week
- Time since the prefect has last done a specific duty
- The amount of times a prefect has done a specific duty
